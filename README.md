# Filipe Esposito's Netshoes Frontend Test

### What is this?
Test project used on Netshoes' selection process for the Frontend Senior Developer [job opening](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/483964032/).

### How to run it
After you cloned this app to your local machine, you need to install all its dependencies before running. If you already have `npm` and `Nodejs` installed in your machine, you can just open a terminal window and type ```npm install```.

Then, in order to run this application, you must type ```npm start```.

Follow the instructions printed on the terminal window, and access `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see it running.

### Notes
You will see all product images are the same. That happens because the `data.json` file provided by Netshoes doesn't contain image URL's inside product data. I therefore opted to show a placeholder image instead of editing the data file provided.
